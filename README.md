# PDF_Combiner

This Python program combines all PDF files in a folder into a single PDF file.

The simple GUI was built with tkinter.  The PDF combination is done with the PyPDF2 module.

File build_pdf_combiner.txt describes my learning curve with pyinstaller.

One or more exectuble versions of the program, created with pyinstaller, are in the "dist" sub-folder
