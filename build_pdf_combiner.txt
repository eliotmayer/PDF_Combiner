Notes about distributing PDF Combiner with pyinstall
====================================================

pyinstaller pdf_combiner_gui.py --additional-hooks-dir=1mJ.ico
Still got error message about the .ico file

After commenting out the line of code that specifies the icon, the following command works.
The created folder can be moved, and a shortcut made to the pdf_combiner_gui.exe file:
pyinstaller pdf_combiner_gui.py

The following also works, but is slower to start up - about 18s vs 1s:

pyinstaller pdf_combiner_gui.py --onefile -w

   Per https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t51bT7WbeCM:
   --onefile creates a standalone .exe file without all the support files.
   -w prevents a commaned window from opening before the GUI opens.

So the best combination is probably this:
pyinstaller pdf_combiner_gui.py -w

2/13/2022:  Commenting out "from PIL import ImageTk, Image" (which was a leftover from tkinter course)
drastically reduced the dist folder contents!  Saved as V1.01, which also deletes "import time" & sleep.

2/15/2022:  The program's command window now lists files not added, so -w is not a good idea.
            Alos, renamed top file, so command is now:

pyinstaller PDF_Combiner.py
or
pyinstaller PDF_Combiner.py --onefile
After the 2/13/2022 change described above, the start-up time of the stand-alone .exe is down to about 
3 seconds, and the files size went from 330MB to 11MB.  So I'll go that route for now.

My builds with pyinstaller are done outside of the GitHub project, and even 
outside of the local project folder (to avoid excessive OneDrive traffic).
However, end products of the build (.exe or .zip) are copied to the "dist"
sub-folder of the local folder / GitHub.
